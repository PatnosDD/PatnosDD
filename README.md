# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Iakobi!

 **Game Developer | Porting Enthusiast**

I'm a passionate developer from Tbilisi, Georgia ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª who specializes in cross-platform game porting & game development. My journey started with modding and evolved into full-fledged game development.

### About Me

- Game Developer experienced with **Unity**, specializing in **reverse-engineering** and **porting games to low-end platforms** like **PlayStation Vita**.
-  Skilled in **C#**, **.NET Core**, **ASP.NET**, **Microsoft SQL**, and building scalable backend systems.
-  I love optimizing code for performance, solving low-level challenges, and pushing the limits of hardware.

### What I'm Working On

-   Bringing more beloved indie games to the **PS Vita** through community-driven porting projects.
-   Jumping into **game jams** whenever I can to build fun, small-scale games and experiment with new ideas.
-   Slowly bringing a personal, **narrative-driven game** to life, one prototype at a time.
